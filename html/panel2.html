 Responsive Web Design is an idea of providing the user with best viewing experience of a website across devices of various sizes. For example, if you are viewing a website on a computer monitor and then viewing it on a smart phone, whose size is smaller than a computer monitor, but you don't need to stumble much to feel the same experience as if you were viewing it on a computer screen, there may be responsive design features enabled on that website.
